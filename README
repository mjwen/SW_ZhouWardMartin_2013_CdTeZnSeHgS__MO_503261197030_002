This directory (Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber_CdTeZnSeHgS__MO_503261197030_001)
contains the parameterization of the Stillinger-Weber potential Model for
Cd, Te, Zn, Se, Hg and S (taken from refernece 3 listed below). Usage of a subset
of the supported species is valid (e.g. use only Cd).


The following files are in this directory:

Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber_CdTeZnSeHgS.params

  first line: 6 (number of species)

  Each data line lists the following 9 parameters for the interaction between
  two species:

  Species1 Species2 A B p q sigma lambda gamma costheta_0 cutoff

  A and lambda are in eV, sigma, gamma, and cutoff are in Angstrom, others are unitless.
  The parameters are taken from reference 3 listed below.
