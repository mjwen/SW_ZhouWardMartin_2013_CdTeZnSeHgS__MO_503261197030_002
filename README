This directory (Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber_CdTeZnSeHgS__MO_000000111111_000) contains the
parameterization of the Stillinger-Weber(SW) potential Model for Cd, Te, Zn, Se, Hg and S.
Usage of a subset of the supported species is valid. For example, to use solely Cd is fine.  

The following files are in this directory:

Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber_CdTeZnSeHgS.params

  first line: 6 (number of species) 
  
  Then each line lists the following 9 parameters for the interaction between two species:
  A(in ev) B p q sigma(in Angstrom) lambda(in eV) gamma(in Angstorm) costheta_0 cutoff
  
  in the following order:
  (1, 1)
  (1, 2)
  (1, 3)
  (1, 4)
  (1, 5)
  (1, 6)
  (2, 2)
  (2, 3)
   .
   .
   .
  (5, 6)
  (6, 6)
  where 1=Cd, 2=Te, 3=Zn, 4=Se, 5=Hg, and 6=S.

Any additional lines will be silently ignored.

The parameters are taken from reference 3 listed below.
